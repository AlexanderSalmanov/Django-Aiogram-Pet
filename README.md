# This is Django+Aiogram project 
- This project is a Django-powered web-page synchronized with Aiogram-powered Telegram Bot.
- It also utilizes Airtable as a secondary DB, speaking clearly: it uploads and extracts TG-related data to/from there, and keeps Project-side User data in PostgreSQL db;
- It allows simple user registration via Bot which allows to redirect to the authorization page.
- Authenticated users are redirected to their ```Profile``` page, where they can see:
  - Their TG user-id;
  - A link to their TG;
  - Their TG full name.
### This project is deployed on Heroku.
